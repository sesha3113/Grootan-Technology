## How To Use

#### Installation

Clone the project into local device. 
Install React Native package , npm, nodejs, bodyparser, express. 
Open project in VS code. 
Run "npx react native run-android".
Open cmd in the path of project server,
Run "nodemon app".
As soon as nodemon runs the application will connect with the MongoDb. 

Since I have focused more on Backend, I couldn't complete few UI tasks. 
I was determined to build my own complete application from scratch. 

#### API Reference
The API was completely build my myself, I have not used any other external website to use mock API. 
API is linked with MongoDB.
Schema is written inside the server.
```html
    
```
